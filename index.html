					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hi there! My name is Kyle and I am an experienced chef from Minnesota.  With over 15 combined years in the food service industry, I have spent over half my life working with the things I love most, food and people.  In December of 2019, I left an exploding chef career behind in Minneapolis with everything I had and a food truck and moved to Austin.  Unfortunately right as the COVID crises began, we were completely crushed, and my business partner had to bring the truck back to Minnesota. Unsure of my future and wanting to better myself in a turbulent time, I found a full-stack computer programming bootcamp program at the University of Texas at Austin, and I immediately fell in love.  The natural and logical structure of writing  code was beautiful to me.   Now that I have graduated, I would like to return to food service to apply my problem solving skills to a help shape a completely new arena post COVID-19.  You might be wondering why I am applying for a position at the Switch in Dripping Springs.  Well, I’d love to just be 100% honest with you, as honestly is a big personal point of emphasis for me in my life.  I stopped by your restaurant last week and I was absolutely blown away.  I was first attracted by your progressive menu.  To me it had the mainstays of traditional Texas BBQ, but with a progressive twist.  To me it screamed forward thinking, and an innovative culinary professional had to be behind it.  Judging by photos and reviews, I could tell the wings were going to be something special, especially with the house made red sauce and white BBQ sauce.  Something that is smoked and then fried?  Sign me up.  The intense smokey BBQ flavor that keeps the wings moist and tender combine with the cackling tight crispy skin from the frying process was incredible.  I also sampled the brisket sandwich just to get a feel for the brisket on the menu.  The brisket quality itself was phenomenal but you already know that.  What really got me was the care put into the toasting of the bun.  A bun that is perfectly crisp and buttered contributes so much to the overall sandwich experience. It is so important. </p>  
					<br>
						<p>I’m beginning to ramble on, and I’m supposed to be marketing myself to be a valued member of your team, not give you a restaurant review!  Upon returning home, I dove into researching your company.  I loved what I found.  I love Shane’s story of how he came to open Stiles Switch.  The railroad stop combined with his namesake is so creative.  Everything I read about Shane’s company has attracted me enough to really want to join your team and contribute in any way I possibly can.  On the Dripping Spring’s location website it appeared to be hiring for all positions, including pitmaster, which is the position opening that really drew me in.  I’ve been managing large scale restaurant operations for multiple years as an executive, including running BOH operations that have live fire and pit based cooking.  My knowledge of traditional BBQ in the Texas sense as well as other regions is extensive.  I believed myself to be more than qualified for this position if the need is there.  Alas as I dove farther into researching your business, I saw that you already have an incredible pitmaster in Christopher!  This has not dissuaded me, but only led me to want to join your team even more.  I would be happy to work under a guy as talented as Christopher, and do whatever I can to help you continue the awesome culinary success you already exhibit. Such is my love for incredible food.  As I finish writing this I have become too hungry again, so I’ll have to wrap this up and call in an order to go pick up later today.  I sincerely hope we can talk soon!
